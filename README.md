# Background and overview of the analysis:
While on vacation in Hawaii I had been inspired to come up with a plan that would allow a sustainable income for living  there permenantly.  This plan involes opening up a **Surf n' Shake Shop**.  I would need some investor backing to turn my business idea into reality.  I have a great investor, W.Avy, who is serious investor but has had bad experience due to an investment that failed because of bad weather conditions.

## Purpose
The purpose of this report is to run analysis with the data set that W.Avy has provided about the weather conditionas on the island of Oahu, where I would like to open up this Surf shop.  Conducting the weather analysis would provide W.Avy the confidence he needs to invest in my **Surf n' Shake Shop**. 

# Results:

## Three key differences in weather between June and December:

June_temperature_summary.png and December_temperature_summary.png files in the resource folder are used for the analysis below.

- The mean temperature of the month of December is approx. 71 F, which is 4 degrees lower than that in June at approx. (75 F).   

- The maximum reached during the month of June is 85 F vs. 83 F in December. The biggest difference is observed in the minimum temperatures that are approximately 8 degrees apart during the two months.  The minimum temperatures reached during the month of December is 56 degrees as oppose to 64 degrees reached in June.

- It is observed that the data between 25th and 75th percentile for December ranges from 69-74 degrees, which is a wider temperature fluctuation and in June ranges between 73-77 degrees, which seems to be a more stable temperature.

# Summary:

Looking at the key observations above, just based on temperature, it is evident that June would most likely be a better month for business due to the higher temperature which could attract more people to the beach and enjoy a cool treat after.  However, there is a high probability that the month of December could also bring a lot of tourist to the island as the temperatures are still favorable.  More research would be required to understand how many people enjoy surfing in December when the water would likely be cooler.  However, it is evident that there will be days in December when the temperatures will get high, and people would like to enjoy ice-cream.  

## Additional queries to performed to gather weather data for June and December

- More research would be required to understand the how much precipitation (rain) does the island get during the month of December and June.  If there is high chance of thunder people would not be in the water which could affect the business.

- Queries can also be performed on the rain and temperature data at various stations during the month of June and December. This could help determine if one location is better than another within the island for setting up the **Surf n' Shake Shop**.

- Additional query can also be performed to see what the outlier temperatures are and if there are more outliers at higher temperatures vs. lower temperatures during the two months.  This could also give an indication on how the business would perform during the two months.

-  Additional queries should also be done on the other months to see how sustainable the business will be throughout the year. This would help to come up with a business plan to see if it would be better to close the business for a couple of months per year as oppose to it running all year long.
